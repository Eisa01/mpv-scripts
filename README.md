To add scripts from this repository, download the desired script in your `mpv/scripts/` directory, for user customizable settings download the related conf file in your `mpv/script-opts/` directory.

**Scripts available in this repository:**
[SmartSkip](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#smartskip), [SmartCopyPaste](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#smartcopypaste), [SmartCopyPaste_II](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#smartcopypaste_ii), [SimpleHistory](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#simplehistory), [SimpleBookmark](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#simplebookmark), [SimpleUndo](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#simpleundo), [UndoRedo](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts#undoredo)

# SmartSkip
You think Netflix is good at binge-watching? Yes, it is.. :) But give SmartSkip a try!
Automatically or manually skip opening, intro, outro, and preview, like never before. Jump to next file, previous file, and save your chapter changes!

### Main Features
* **Smart Next / Prev:** Automatically triggers Skip to Silence, Chapter Next/ Prev, or Playlist Next/ Prev based on configurable parameters.
- **Skip to Silence:** If the file you are watching is not chaptered, skipping to silence will attempt to skip the intro and outro by finding the silence in the file (optionally: chapter automatically created).
- **Auto Skip**: If the file you are watching has organized chapters, any opening, ending sound can be automatically skipped after your **preferred countdown** time.
- **Chapters Modification:** Create, remove, edit chapters,  and then save changes into an external file or bake them into the mkv file.
- **Chapter Next / Prev:** Go to next chapter, if no chapters available go to next playlist, and vise-versa (like the good times with MPC-HC).
- **Customization:** Tons of user customizable settings that can even change the behavior and priority of smart-next, smart-prev, auto-skip, and more!
- **OSD** (On Screen Display): Displays a proper OSD for the actions preformed through SmartSkip.
- **More:** This is not all! Explore the conf file to learn more about the possibilities you are missing out...
### Compatibility
- Works on all of mpv supported platforms.
